# Doria language server

This crate builds the standalone `doria-lsp` executable. It owns LSP transport, document state, UTF-16 position mapping, compiler-diagnostic adaptation, completion, hover, and code actions.

Language behavior comes from the exact `doriac` revision pinned by the workspace manifest and lockfile. Do not copy compiler parsing or semantic rules into this crate.

The pinned compiler supplies Stage 30d closure-aware HIR, MIR, debug-interpreter
execution, function-value ownership, lifetime, escape, diagnostic, fix, and hover
facts. The server only adapts those structured facts to LSP. Ordinary editor
analysis is target-neutral and does not publish `E0641` for valid closures; native
execution remains Stage 30e and PHP lowering remains Stage 30f.

From the repository root:

```bash
php scripts/build.php server
./target/debug/doria-lsp --version
```

The wrapper runs `cargo build --locked --bin doria-lsp` and prints the executable's absolute path. The default output is `target/debug/doria-lsp` (`target\debug\doria-lsp.exe` on Windows), relative to the repository root rather than this crate directory.

Install the server into Cargo's global bin directory with:

```bash
php scripts/build.php install-server
doria-lsp --version
```

Run the server checks directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
```

Without arguments, `doria-lsp` serves LSP over stdin/stdout. Use `doria-lsp --version` to inspect the server package and compatible canonical Doria toolchain versions.
