# Doria Language Support

This extension provides `.doria` language registration, TextMate syntax highlighting, attribute highlighting, editor bracket/comment behavior, and diagnostics from `doria-lsp`.

Editor releases track the Doria toolchain CalVer. The target toolchain release is `2026.03.1-canary`; the VS Code Marketplace manifest encodes it as the SemVer-compatible `2026.3.1-canary` because its required `version` field does not permit a zero-padded numeric month.

Syntax colors depend on the active VS Code theme. This extension improves Doria's TextMate scopes for cleaner highlighting, but it does not ship a custom color theme yet.

The TextMate grammar is editor support only. It highlights accepted and planned Doria vocabulary from the master plan so `.doria` files and Markdown `doria` fences stay readable, but highlighting does not mean the compiler implements every highlighted planned construct.

Double-quoted interpolation uses the ordinary Doria expression grammar, so expressions such as `{left() + right()}` receive normal token scopes inside the string. Literal opening braces use `\{`; single-quoted strings remain non-interpolating.

During the repository split, build the language server from a Doria compiler checkout located anywhere on your system and expose the resulting executable through `DORIA_LSP_PATH`:

```bash
cargo build \
  --manifest-path "/absolute/path/to/compiler-checkout/Cargo.toml" \
  -p doriac \
  --bin doria-lsp
export DORIA_LSP_PATH="/absolute/path/to/compiler-checkout/target/debug/doria-lsp"
```

If `doria-lsp` is already on `PATH`, no environment variable is required. If `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set, point `DORIA_LSP_PATH` at the executable in that target directory. Once the standalone server source moves into this repository, the root README will replace this transition command with the repository-local build command.

The extension resolves the server from:

```text
1. doria.languageServer.path
2. DORIA_LSP_PATH
3. target/debug/doria-lsp in the open workspace
4. doria-lsp on PATH
```

No npm dependencies are required for the development extension.

After changing the TextMate grammar, reload the VS Code window or restart the Extension Development Host so VS Code reads the updated grammar.

Keep this TextMate grammar aligned with the IntelliJ / JetBrains highlighter under `editors/intellij/doria`. From the repository root, run:

```bash
php scripts/check_editor_highlighting.php
```

Files under `editors/fixtures/` are syntax-highlighting smoke fixtures. The VS Code client keeps them out of `doria-lsp` diagnostics so accepted/planned editor vocabulary can be exercised before compiler implementation lands.

Doria uses distinct spellings for imports and trait composition: file/namespace-scope `use` imports names from namespaces, while class-body or trait-body `uses` composes traits. The TextMate grammar keeps these scopes separate as import use and trait-composition uses.
